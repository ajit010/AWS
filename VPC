Understanding CIDR – IPv4
• Classless Inter-Domain Routing – a method for allocating IP addresses
• Used in Security Groups rules and AWS networking in general
• They help to define an IP address range:
• We’ve seen WW.XX.YY.ZZ/32 => one IP
• We’ve seen 0.0.0.0/0 => all IPs
• But we can define:192.168.0.0/26 =>192.168.0.0 – 192.168.0.63 (64 IP addresses)

Understanding CIDR 
– IPv4
• A CIDR consists of two components • Base IP • Represents an IP contained in the range (XX.XX.XX.XX) • Example: 10.0.0.0, 192.168.0.0, … • Subnet Mask • Defines how many bits can change in the IP • Example: /0, /24, /32 • Can take two forms: • /8 ó 255.0.0.0 • /16 ó 255.255.0.0 • /24 ó 255.255.255.0 • /32 ó 255.255.255.255


Understanding CIDR – Subnet Mask
• The Subnet Mask basically allows part of the underlying IP to get 
additional next values from the base IP
192 . 168 . 0 . 0 /32 => allows for 1 IP (2!) 192.168.0.0
192 . 168 . 0 . 0 /31 => allows for 2 IP (2") 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.1
192 . 168 . 0 . 0 /30 => allows for 4 IP (2#) 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.3
192 . 168 . 0 . 0 /29 => allows for 8 IP (2$) 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.7
192 . 168 . 0 . 0 /28 => allows for 16 IP (2%) 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.15
192 . 168 . 0 . 0 /27 => allows for 32 IP (2&) 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.31
192 . 168 . 0 . 0 /26 => allows for 64 IP (2') 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.63
192 . 168 . 0 . 0 /25 => allows for 128 IP (2() 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.127
192 . 168 . 0 . 0 /24 => allows for 256 IP (2)) 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.255
… 192 . 168 . 0 . 0 /16 => allows for 65,536 IP (2"') 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.255.255
… 192 . 168 . 0 . 0 /0 => allows for All IPs 0.0.0.0 -> 255.255.255.255



Understanding CIDR – Little Exercise
• 192.168.0.0/24 = … ?
• 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.0.255 (256 IPs)
• 192.168.0.0/16 = … ?
• 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (65,536 IPs)
• 134.56.78.123/32 = … ?
• Just 134.56.78.123
• 0.0.0.0/0
• All IPs!

Public vs. Private IP (IPv4)
• The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) established certain 
blocks of IPv4 addresses for the use of private (LAN) and public 
(Internet) addresses
• Private IP can only allow certain values:
• 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8) ç in big networks
• 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12) ç AWS default VPC in that range
• 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) ç e.g., home networks
• All the rest of the IP addresses on the Internet are Public


Default VPC Walkthrough
• All new AWS accounts have a default VPC
• New EC2 instances are launched into the default VPC if no subnet is 
specified
• Default VPC has Internet connectivity and all EC2 instances inside it 
have public IPv4 addresses
• We also get a public and a private IPv4 DNS names


VPC in AWS – IPv4
• VPC = Virtual Private Cloud
• You can have multiple VPCs in an AWS region (max. 5 per region – soft limit)
• Max. CIDR per VPC is 5, for each CIDR:
• Min. size is /28 (16 IP addresses)
• Max. size is /16 (65536 IP addresses)
• Because VPC is private, only the Private IPv4 ranges are allowed:
• 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8) 
• 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12) 
• 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)
• Your VPC CIDR should NOT overlap with your other networks (e.g., corporate)



VPC – Subnet (IPv4)
• AWS reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 & last 1) in each subnet
• These 5 IP addresses are not available for use and can’t be assigned to an 
EC2 instance
• Example: if CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are:
• 10.0.0.0 – Network Address
• 10.0.0.1 – reserved by AWS for the VPC router
• 10.0.0.2 – reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS
• 10.0.0.3 – reserved by AWS for future use
• 10.0.0.255 – Network Broadcast Address. AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore the address is reserved
• Exam Tip, if you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instances:
• You can’t choose a subnet of size /27 (32 IP addresses, 32 – 5 = 27 < 29)
• You need to choose a subnet of size /26 (64 IP addresses, 64 – 5 = 59 > 29)



Internet Gateway (IGW)
• Allows resources (e.g., EC2 instances) in a VPC connect to the Internet
• It scales horizontally and is highly available and redundant
• Must be created separately from a VPC
• One VPC can only be attached to one IGW and vice versa
• Internet Gateways on their own do not allow Internet access…
• Route tables must also be edited



NAT Gateway
• AWS-managed NAT, higher bandwidth, high availability, no administration
• Pay per hour for usage and bandwidth
• NATGW is created in a specific Availability Zone, uses an Elastic IP
• Can’t be used by EC2 instance in the same subnet (only from other 
subnets)
• Requires an IGW (Private Subnet => NATGW => IGW)
• 5 Gbps of bandwidth with automatic scaling up to 45 Gbps
• No Security Groups to manage / required
