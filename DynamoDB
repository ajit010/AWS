Amazon DynamoDB :

• Fully managed, highly available with replication across multiple AZs
• NoSQL database - not a relational database - with transaction support
• Scales to massive workloads, distributed database
• Millions of requests per seconds, trillions of row, 100s of TB of storage
• Fast and consistent in performance (single-digit millisecond)
• Integrated with IAM for security, authorization and administration
• Low cost and auto-scaling capabilities
• No maintenance or patching, always available
• Standard & Infrequent Access (IA) Table Class



DynamoDB - Basics :

• DynamoDB is made of Tables
• Each table has a Primary Key (must be decided at creation time)
• Each table can have an infinite number of items (= rows)
• Each item has attributes (can be added over time – can be null)
• Maximum size of an item is 400KB

• Data types supported are:
    • Scalar Types – String, Number, Binary, Boolean, Null
    • Document Types – List, Map
    • Set Types – String Set, Number Set, Binary Set

• Therefore, in DynamoDB you can rapidly evolve schemas



DynamoDB – Read/Write Capacity Modes :

• Control how you manage your table’s capacity (read/write throughput)

• Provisioned Mode (default)
    • You specify the number of reads/writes per second
    • You need to plan capacity beforehand
    • Pay for provisioned Read Capacity Units (RCU) & Write Capacity Units (WCU)
    • Possibility to add auto-scaling mode for RCU & WCU

• On-Demand Mode
    • Read/writes automatically scale up/down with your workloads
    • No capacity planning needed
    • Pay for what you use, more expensive ($$$)
    • Great for unpredictable workloads, steep sudden spikes



DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) :

• Fully-managed, highly available, seamless inmemory cache for DynamoDB
• Help solve read congestion by caching
• Microseconds latency for cached data
• Doesn’t require application logic modification (compatible with existing DynamoDB APIs)
• 5 minutes TTL for cache (default)



DynamoDB Global Tables :

• Make a DynamoDB table accessible with low latency in multiple-regions
• Active-Active replication
• Applications can READ and WRITE to the table in any region 
• Must enable DynamoDB Streams as a pre-requisite



DynamoDB –Time To Live (TTL) :

• Automatically delete items after an expiry timestamp

• Use cases: reduce stored data by keeping only current items, adhere to regulatory obligations, web session handling…



DynamoDB – Backups for disaster recovery :

• Continuous backups using point-in-time recovery (PITR)
    • Optionally enabled for the last 35 days
    • Point-in-time recovery to any time within the backup window
    • The recovery process creates a new table

• On-demand backups
    • Full backups for long-term retention, until explicitely deleted
    • Doesn’t affect performance or latency
    • Can be configured and managed in AWS Backup (enables cross-region copy)
    • The recovery process creates a new table
