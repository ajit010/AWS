Amazon SQS – Standard Queue :

• Oldest offering (over 10 years old)
• Fully managed service, used to decouple applications 

• Attributes:
    • Unlimited throughput, unlimited number of messages in queue
    • Default retention of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days
    • Low latency (<10 ms on publish and receive)
    • Limitation of 256KB per message sent

• Can have duplicate messages (at least once delivery, occasionally)
• Can have out of order messages (best effort ordering)



SQS – Producing Messages :

• Produced to SQS using the SDK (SendMessage API)
• The message is persisted in SQS until a consumer deletes it
• Message retention: default 4 days, up to 14 days

• Example: send an order to be processed 
    • Order id
    • Customer id
    • Any attributes you want 

• SQS standard: unlimited throughput



SQS – Consuming Messages :

• Consumers (running on EC2 instances, servers, or AWS Lambda)…
• Poll SQS for messages (receive up to 10 messages at a time)
• Process the messages (example: insert the message into an RDS database)
• Delete the messages using the DeleteMessage API



Amazon SQS - Security :

• Encryption:
    • In-flight encryption using HTTPS API
    • At-rest encryption using KMS keys
    • Client-side encryption if the client wants to perform encryption/decryption itself 

• Access Controls: IAM policies to regulate access to the SQS API

• SQS Access Policies (similar to S3 bucket policies)
    • Useful for cross-account access to SQS queues
    • Useful for allowing other services (SNS, S3…) to write to an SQS queue



SQS – Message Visibility Timeout :

• After a message is polled by a consumer, it becomes invisible to other consumers
• By default, the “message visibility timeout” is 30 seconds
• That means the message has 30 seconds to be processed
• After the message visibility timeout is over, the message is “visible” in SQS

• If a message is not processed within the visibility timeout, it will be processed twice
• A consumer could call the ChangeMessageVisibility API to get more time
• If visibility timeout is high (hours), and consumer crashes, re-processing will take time
• If visibility timeout is too low (seconds), we may get duplicates




Amazon SQS – FIFO Queue :

• FIFO = First In First Out (ordering of messages in the queue)
• Limited throughput: 300 msg/s without batching, 3000 msg/s with
• Exactly-once send capability (by removing duplicates)
• Messages are processed in order by the consumer
