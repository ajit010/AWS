Amazon SNS :

• The “event producer” only sends message to one SNS topic
• As many “event receivers” (subscriptions) as we want to listen to the SNS topic notifications
• Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages (note: new feature to filter messages)
• Up to 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic
• 100,000 topics limit


Amazon SNS – Security :

• Encryption:
    • In-flight encryption using HTTPS API
    • At-rest encryption using KMS keys
    • Client-side encryption if the client wants to perform encryption/decryption itself 

• Access Controls: IAM policies to regulate access to the SNS API

• SNS Access Policies (similar to S3 bucket policies)
    • Useful for cross-account access to SNS topics 
    • Useful for allowing other services ( S3…) to write to an SNS topic
