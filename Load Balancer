What is load balancing?

• Load Balances are servers that forward traffic to multiple servers (e.g., EC2 instances) downstream



Why use a load balancer? 

• Spread load across multiple downstream instances 
• Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application 
• Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances 
• Do regular health checks to your instances 
• Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites 
• Enforce stickiness with cookies 
• High availability across zones 
• Separate public traffic from private traffic




Why use an Elastic Load Balancer?

• An Elastic Load Balancer is a managed load balancer
• AWS guarantees that it will be working
• AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
• AWS provides only a few configuration knobs
• It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end
• It is integrated with many AWS offerings / services
• EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon ECS
• AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
• Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator



Health Checks

• Health Checks are crucial for Load Balancers
• They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests
• The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
• If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy



Application Load Balancer :

• Application load balancers is Layer 7 (HTTP)
• Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines 
(target groups)
• Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine 
(ex: containers)
• Support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket
• Support redirects (from HTTP to HTTPS for example)



Application Load Balancer :

• Routing tables to different target groups:
• Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
• Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
• Routing based on Query String, Headers 
(example.com/users?id=123&order=false)
• ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application 
(example: Docker & Amazon ECS)
• Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS



Application Load Balancer :

Target Groups
• EC2 instances (can be managed by an Auto Scaling Group) – HTTP 
• ECS tasks (managed by ECS itself) – HTTP 
• Lambda functions – HTTP request is translated into a JSON event
• IP Addresses – must be private IPs
• ALB can route to multiple target groups
• Health checks are at the target group level
